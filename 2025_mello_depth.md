# Exploring depth on Chr8L

I suspect that the signal on Chr8L is due to some males having atypically high depth and these positions are then being better called as pseudoheterozygous. TO test this I am quantifying depth at the 76 positions that are het in the father and at lest five sons and comparing this to the chromosome-wide depth.
